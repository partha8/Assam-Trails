Kalika Puran, a mythical Hindu text suggests that at the beginning of creation, Shiva was busy in meditation, when Kamdeva, the God of love and desire, came and interrupted his ritual. Shiva became angry, and with a glance burned him into ashes. He then sprinkled the ashes at this spot. Since Kamadeva was burned down at this place, the hill is called bhasmachala or bhasmakuta. The temple has a presiding deity called Umananda, another appearance of Shiva. On the day of Shiva Chaturdashi, a fair is held in the area, which is an attraction for devotees. ",
